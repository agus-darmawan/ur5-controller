The software architecture consists of three main nodes (Perception Node, Controller Node, UR Interface) and an RViz GUI for visualization and interaction.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2 Humble
- Network connection with a static IP address for the USV

## Package Description

The package is structured as follows:

- **Perception Node**: Handles camera data and processes using mediapie for the controller node.
- **Controller Node**: Manages the logic for controlling the UR5 robot based on input from the perception node and user commands from the RViz GUI.
- **UR Interface**: Communicates with the UR5 hardware to execute control commands.
- **RViz GUI**: Provides a graphical interface for visualization and interaction with the robot system.
